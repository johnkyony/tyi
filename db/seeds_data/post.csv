1,Underwear Sniffing: That’s a thing,"There are many sexual fetishes around the world but did you know that people actually get it off by sniffing soiled underwear?

Yep. That’s an actual thing.

Bromidrophilia is the more scientific word for it which means: when an individual finds the natural body odors of a person to be the most arousing erotic stimulus imaginable.

Urban Dictionary on the other hand gives a more explicit but easily understandable definition of a “Panty Sniffer”: “A person who sniffs women’s underwear for sexual gratification.”

A fetish or “fetishism” is characterised as a disorder when there is a pathological assignment of sexual fixation, fantasies, or behaviors toward an inanimate object.

As explained by Psychology Today, the object of affection is commonly an item of clothing, such as a high-heeled shoe, or in this case, underwear.

Getting a “high” off sniffing some used undies doesn’t just apply to lady knickers. It ranges from stockings, bras, pantyhose and even jockstraps.


Dr. Micheal Aron; a NYC sex therapist and author states that “lots of men enjoy the smell of a vagina, particularly when the woman is aroused and lubricated…People release pheromones, a unique scent that may often be sexually stimulating.”

So the “sweet” smell that releases from ones genitals could actually be such a turn on for so many people that happen to have this fetish.

Now you know!

That your dirty under garments could be the next best thing for your current/potential lover.

2,Zuma ain’t going anywhere,"OHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma has survived a second attempt to force him to step down in at the ANC’s national executive committee meeting on Sunday night, IOL reports.

It was apparently agreed, as a compromise between bitterly divided groups to refer the issue of Zuma’s continued leadership to a committee of 10 members. The move to remove Zuma from office was seemingly deferred on procedural grounds.

A source told Independent Media: “It was not decided how the committee would be formed. There was also no finalisation of its composition.”
The motion against Zuma, who will face MPs on Wednesday for the presidency’s budget, was tabled by the ANC’s policy guru, Joel Netshitenzhe, on Saturday.

The move was supported by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and his deputy Joe Phaahla, axed tourism minister Derek Hanekom and NEC member Sue van der Merwe, according to sources.

At an ANC NEC meeting in December Hanekom, since dismissed by Zuma from Cabinet, proposed a motion of no confidence in him, but it was squashed.

At the end Zuma reportedly lashed out at his detractors whom he accused of pursuing a foreign agenda to oust him.

Political analyst Protas Madlala said the possible removal of Zuma would have far-reaching implications as it would also see a mass exodus of his backers in Parliament.

“What surprises me is why the president is being asked to step down, whereas Thabo Mbeki was told in no uncertain terms to do so,” said Madlala.

He said the ANC needs to take a similar hard line against Zuma.

Sunday’s meeting took place against the backdrop of the most damning newspaper reports yet against Zuma’s controversial friends, the Guptas, revealing the business family’s influence on the state allegedly through Zuma and his son Duduzane.

Meanwhile, Zuma has to give reasons on Monday in the Pretoria High Court for his midnight Cabinet reshuffle, one of the reasons his future at the Union Buildings hangs in the balance.

Arthur was convicted of killing riverboat engineer Troy Wicker, who was fatally shot as he slept in his bed in the north Alabama city of Muscle Shoals.

“Thirty-four years after he was first sentenced to death…Thomas Arthur’s protracted attempt to escape justice is finally at an end,” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement. “Most importantly, tonight, the family of Troy Wicker can begin the long-delayed process of recovery from a painful loss.”

In his final statement, Arthur appeared to cry and got choked up as he said he wanted to apologize to his four children and said each of their names. “I’m sorry I failed you as a father. I love you more than anything on earth,” Arthur said. He waved his fingers up in the direction of his daughters, who watched from a witness room.

Wicker’s two sons witnessed the execution but did not make a statement to the media.

The AL Supreme Court set execution dates for two men on Alabama's death row: May 25 for Tommy Arthur and June 8 for Robert Melson. Terrible.

Arthur’s lawyers filed a flurry of last-minute appeals in a bid to halt the execution, but the U.S. Supreme Court opened the way for the execution to proceed shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday.

The state prison system began administering the lethal injection drugs around 11:50 p.m. before the death warrant expired at midnight. He was not pronounced dead until after midnight.

Wicker’s wife, Judy, initially told police she came home and was raped by a black man who shot and killed her husband. After her conviction, she changed her story and testified she had discussed killing her husband with Arthur, who came to the house in makeup and an Afro-style wig and shot her husband.

She said she paid him $10,000. Arthur was in a prison work-release program at the time for the 1977 slaying of his sister-in-law, a crime he admits to committing.

His first two convictions in the Wicker case were overturned, but the third one was not. Arthur asked jurors to give him the death penalty. The decision was strategic, he said, to open up more avenues of appeal.

The state set seven execution dates for Arthur between 2001 and 2016. All were delayed as a pro bono legal team fought his sentence. In 2016, Arthur came especially close to the death chamber.

In a telephone interview Monday, Arthur maintained his innocence but acknowledged that his chance of another stay was diminishing.

“I’m terrified, but there’s nothing I can do,” Arthur told The Associated Press.

Janette Grantham, director of the Victims of Crime and Leniency, called the years of execution delays exceedingly painful for the family of Troy Wicker to bear.

Earlier, Arthur’s attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the execution. The lawyers have argued that the opening sedative in Alabama’s execution protocol — midazolam — wouldn’t properly anesthetize him before he’s injected with other drugs to stop his heart and lungs.

In December, inmate Ronald Bert Smith coughed for the first 13 minutes of his execution and moved slightly after two consciousness tests. Arthur’s lawyers argued that Smith was awake during his execution. The state responded that there was no evidence Smith experienced pain.

Both the state of Alabama and Arthur’s lawyers have pointed to his case as an example of what they see wrong in death penalty cases.

Arthur’s lawyer said the state had sought DNA testing on hairs collected at the crime scene.

The state attorney general said Arthur used perpetual litigation to avoid the death sentence for years.
